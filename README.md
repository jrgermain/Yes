# Yes
Some concise implementations of [yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(Unix)) I wrote for fun with the goal of using as few characters as possible.

## yes.scala

Run using `scala yes.scala` to output "y" until killed or `scala yes.scala mystring` to output "mystring" until killed. To kill the process, hit Ctrl-C.

## yes.js

The easiest way to test this is to paste the contents of yes.js into your web browser console. Doing this defines a function, y. Then you can type `y()` to output "y" repeatedly or `y("mystring")` to output "mystring" repeatedly.
